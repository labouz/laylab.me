### The RIGHT NOW

*This is page is inspired by: "What's up? How's life?"*

If anyone's even remotely interested in the above questions, here's what you need to know:

Ok, it's been a minute, I know. Work has not really calmed down since last we spoke and I am working fewer hours. Why fewer hours? Well, let me take a few steps back....

(*in narrator voice*) Previously, on "Right NOW", our heroine jumps the  hurdels of beurocracy at the Univrsity of Miami while trying to publish a badass COVID-19 public dashboard. She has since published said Dashboard, turned 29 and decided she was going to go back to school üò≤ But why, you ask? Because, she became tired of being the tool and wanted to be the architect. Being a public heath data scientist has brougt her tremendous joy and she grew significanty, thanks to the support of her super-mentors, but there came a point where all young heroins must rise up and fight their own battles.

Ok, enough of the superhero metaphor, I'm really not that dramatic. But yes, in Novemeber I decided that research was my fate and that the only way I was truly going to grow into my own skin was by get those damn three letters after my name - PhD. That's pretty serious for me. I swore after my masters that I was done. What changed? The hell if I know. What I do know is that The Universe has been sending me signs to go for it left and right and I do not ignore signs from The Universe. 

So now I am temporarily working part-time to focus on grad school applications. Work is piling up but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I plan to return to full-time in February once the last of my applications has been submitted but until then, full time workload will have to just take a seat while I power thru. I won't reveal where I've applied to but that's where my focus has been these past couple months (I'll announce it here when I get decisions!), hence the pause in posts. Not fret, more posts to come.

In other news, I got a package published to [CRAN](https://ctn-0094.github.io/DOPE/) for the first time!! The name is pretty dope.

In other other news, we celebrated an anniversary and went to Sint Maarten/Saint Martin. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. Highly recommend. I had very minimal worry about COVID while on the island. Because of cruise liners not sailing at the moment, there were significantly less tourists which, I feel, allowed me a much more authentic experience.

That's it for now. Stay tuned...

Oh, and because all the cool kids have one....
