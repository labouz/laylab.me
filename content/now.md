### The RIGHT NOW

_This is page is inspired by: "What's up? How's life?"_

If anyone's even remotely interested in the above questions, here's what you need to know:

So, I got in! Into PhD programs that is... I've decided to accept my offer to Drexel University's Doctorol Program in Information Science with a Drexel Blue Fellowship - go me! This is a huge step. I won't lie, I've been in academia my whole life and this is a bit scary - still. I've already begun my first PhD Seminar in Case-Based Reasoning with my advisor, Dr.Rosina Weber, who is an expert in what appears to be a pretty niche field. My colleagues seem amazing so far so that eases the intimidation a bit but still can't help the feeling I'm completely out of my league here. Welp, here goes nothing...

In other news, I'm officially moved to Philadelphia. We bought a cute home in the Point Breeze neighborhood. Hopefully by the end of the year, all the boxes will be unpacked and I will learn how to get home without the help of Miss Google Maps ðŸ˜…. So far, I'm loving it! It's still warm (hot even) and the communal vibes are real. That's something I've missed in Miami. I had friends and found community when I went actively searched for it but here, community has come to me. I've already met a few neighbors on my block and have become a regular at my local coffee shop (_read: temp office_)!

What about UM, you ask? Well, as off August 2nd I am officially resigned. The University has been a critical step in my growth and wouldn't be where I am now without all my amazing mentors there. I will forever be grateful to them. This is not the last they'll see of me. As anything in academia goes, research lives on. I will passively continue contributing to the projects (specifically my package, [DOPE](https://github.com/CTN-0094/DOPE)) on which my role was critical.

As for [R-Ladies Miami](https://twitter.com/RLadiesMiami), I have one more meetup to organize and then my role will shift as a passive organizer/cheerleader! So, if there are any passionate R-Ladies reading this, based in Miami, who would like to co-organize this group with other awesome ladies and with the commitment and fervor it deserves - DM me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bouzoulay)!

Oh, I almost forgot our new fur babies! ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜» Internet, meet Stevie (grey) and Selena (orange). We adopted them, and their mama and brother, during a trip to Costa Rica (yes, I brought cats into the US and it did take two trips - reach out if you want to know _that_ story, we can do virtual coffee ðŸ¤£).

That's it for now. Stay tuned...

Oh, and because all the cool kids have one....
