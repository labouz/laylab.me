description: 'A quick and dirty way to expose your API built with the plumber R package'

<p>If you had asked me two years ago to use and API in my scripts, much less develop and deploy them, I probably would have hid under
my desk. Well, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have actually hid, but I would have wanted to. Developing APIs can seem quite daunting at first, but I promise, it‚Äôs really not. If <em>I</em> can do it <em>YOU</em> definitely can!</p>
<p>I am going to show how to build an API, first and then expose it in less than 5 minutes, are you ready?!</p>
<p>First a little on APIs to get your head in the right place. ü§ì</p>
<div id="what-is-an-api" class="section level3">
<h3>What is an API?</h3>
<div id="application-program-interface" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogram <strong>I</strong>nterface</h4>
<p>In short, it allows a user to programatically pull data from a source given that source provides one<br />
<em>ex. The NYT, Twitter, Facebook, Google, US Census</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-does-it-work" class="section level3">
<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Think of it like this, just like a Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows you to interact with your code, an API lets your code interact with other code</li>
<li>Set of commands, functions, objects, and protocols
<ul>
<li>used to create software or interact with an external system (databases)</li>
<li>everywhere!</li>
<li>convenient- ready-made code to simplify the life of a programmer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="not-only-for-getting-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Not Only for Getting Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build APIs for your ML models so others can use them</li>
<li>Write (post) to a database
<ul>
<li>and update (put) and delete (delete)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Functions
<ul>
<li>more control over what is exposed to end user</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, enough of that, let‚Äôs build one shall we?? üòâ</p>
<p>Lucky for us, <code>plumber</code> makes this step <em>really</em> easy! I‚Äôm not going to go into the weeds of the details. The documentation does a really good job at this, so why be redundant!? We‚Äôre here for the part after that!
FYI:<br />
üì¶: <code>plumber</code><br />
üìñ: <a href="https://www.rplumber.io/" class="uri">https://www.rplumber.io/</a></p>
<p>Here, we want to expose an API that returns a dynamic plot using <code>ggplot2::ggplot()</code> and <code>plotly::ggplotly()</code>, specifically we are plotting the distribution of our favorite <code>mtcars$cyl</code> data.</p>
<p><em>Wait, a couple steps back. Why are we exposing and not deploying? And what is exposing, anyways?</em></p>
<p>Good question, when you run a service such as an API or a Shiny app, for example, locally on your computer, you are running it as a server behind the scenes. You can access it through your browser by typing <code>localhost:portNumber</code>. <em>Exposing</em> your service is when we make this internal address (localhost) available on the internet. We are exposing whatever service on the particular port by giving it an external(public) URL.</p>
<p>Why would we do this? Well, if you are building models or various other objects meant for production, it would be a bit of a pain to constantly build and re-deploy, especially during the beginning stages when you are more prone to bugs. You could really piss off some engineers that way! Exposing your API is a good way to test before you deploy to your production server üòä</p>
<p>So, let‚Äôs get to it! Let‚Äôs start with our API:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
#* Plot a dynamic histogram
#* @serializer htmlwidget
#* @get /plotly
function(){
  data(mtcars)
  x &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = as.factor(cyl))) +
    geom_bar(fill= c(&quot;#8245BF&quot;, &quot;#05F29B&quot;, &quot;#F2CB05&quot;)) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = &quot;cylinders&quot;)

  ggplotly(x)
}</code></pre>
<p>To run your API locally just save the above script somewhere you can find it and run the following two commands in the console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(plumber)
r &lt;- plumb(&quot;plumber.R&quot;)
r$run(port = 8000) #this will run your api on localhost, port: 8000.</code></pre>
<p>When you run this you will get a screen like this from swagger:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-07-08-the-api-and-i-exposing-a-pluber-api.en_files/api_swagger.png" /></p>
<p>FYI, your local address will be localhost:8000/plotly</p>
<div id="now-to-the-fun-part" class="section level4">
<h4>Now to the fun part!</h4>
<p>For exposing our API, we will use a service called <a href="https://ngrok.com/download">ngrok</a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You will have to create an account, this is how you will get your authentication token. The easiest would to authenticate is with your GitHub account, if you have one.</li>
<li>Download the installation for your operating system</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-07-08-the-api-and-i-exposing-a-pluber-api.en_files/ngrok_download.png" width="600" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open your terminal</li>
<li>Unzip the ngrok installation files</li>
<li><code>cd</code> into that directory and authenticate the application (see picture below)
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>./ngrok authtoken YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN</code></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-07-08-the-api-and-i-exposing-a-pluber-api.en_files/ngrok_auth.png" /></p>
<p>Now it‚Äôs time to expose your API! üòé</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hopefully, you still have the localhost served. If not, just run <code>r$run(port=8000)</code> again and you should be good.</li>
<li>Open your terminal again. Make sure you‚Äôre in the directory where you unzipped ngrok (Applications, for me) and run <code>./ngrok http 8000</code> and that‚Äôs it! You have now exposed port 8000 on your computer. If all went well, you should get a screen like this:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-07-08-the-api-and-i-exposing-a-pluber-api.en_files/ngrok_expose.png" /></p>
<p>Now, all you have to do is share! Copy and paste the ‚ÄúForwarding‚Äù URL and add the path to your API and send it out for testing!</p>
