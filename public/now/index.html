<p><em>This is page is inspired by: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? How&rsquo;s life?&quot;</em></p>
<p>If anyone&rsquo;s even remotely interested in the above questions, here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p>
<p>Ok, it&rsquo;s been a minute, I know. Work has not really calmed down since last we spoke and I am working fewer hours. Why fewer hours? Well, let me take a few steps back&hellip;.</p>
<p>(<em>in narrator voice</em>) Previously, on &ldquo;Right NOW&rdquo;, our heroine jumps the  hurdels of beurocracy at the Univrsity of Miami while trying to publish a badass COVID-19 public dashboard. She has since published said Dashboard, turned 29 and decided she was going to go back to school üò≤ But why, you ask? Because, she became tired of being the tool and wanted to be the architect. Being a public heath data scientist has brougt her tremendous joy and she grew significanty, thanks to the support of her super-mentors, but there came a point where all young heroins must rise up and fight their own battles.</p>
<p>Ok, enough of the superhero metaphor, I&rsquo;m really not that dramatic. But yes, in Novemeber I decided that research was my fate and that the only way I was truly going to grow into my own skin was by get those damn three letters after my name - PhD. That&rsquo;s pretty serious for me. I swore after my masters that I was done. What changed? The hell if I know. What I do know is that The Universe has been sending me signs to go for it left and right and I do not ignore signs from The Universe.</p>
<p>So now I am temporarily working part-time to focus on grad school applications. Work is piling up but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I plan to return to full-time in February once the last of my applications has been submitted but until then, full time workload will have to just take a seat while I power thru. I won&rsquo;t reveal where I&rsquo;ve applied to but that&rsquo;s where my focus has been these past couple months (I&rsquo;ll announce it here when I get decisions!), hence the pause in posts. Not fret, more posts to come.</p>
<p>In other news, I got a package published to <a href="https://ctn-0094.github.io/DOPE/">CRAN</a> for the first time!! The name is pretty dope.</p>
<p>In other other news, we celebrated an anniversary and went to Sint Maarten/Saint Martin. ‚ú®IT WAS BEAUTIFUL‚ú® Highly recommend. I had very minimal worry about COVID while on the island. Because of cruise liners not sailing at the moment, there were significantly less tourists which, I feel, allowed me a much more authentic experience.</p>
