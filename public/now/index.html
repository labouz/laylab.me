<p><em>This is page is inspired by: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? How&rsquo;s life?&quot;</em></p>
<p>If anyone&rsquo;s even remotely interested in the above questions, here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p>
<p>First year of my doctoral program successfully completed! one down, x more to go ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I think I can confidently say that these past three quarters went well and that I may be getting the hang of balancing coursework, TA/RA-ship, and staying on top of research. One thing I&rsquo;m still not getting the hang of is the quarter system. Yes, you get through your required courses faster, but what do you learn? In 10 weeks you are only exposed to new concepts and then have to go deeper on your own if you want. I guess, that prevents students from spending too much time on topics that don&rsquo;t necessarily pertain to them. If that&rsquo;s the case, then I can get with it.</p>
<p>Other than pretty okay in courses, I was awarded the Outstanding Teaching Assistant for Graduate Studies award at this year&rsquo;s CCI honor&rsquo;s ceremony. Go me! Research is shaping up pretty nicely. It is slowly morphing into something more definite as a dissertation and I am lucky to have a new member of the CCI faculty as my advisor, <a href="https://shadirezapour.com">Dr. Shadi Rezapour</a>! She&rsquo;s been essential in motivating me to stay on top and go for various opportunities. Unfortunately, I did not get the Bloomberg PhD data science fellowship thi round but you bet I will be trying again next year! In the meantime, catch me submitting to various conferences ;)</p>
<p>This summer I am doing an apprenticeship with the Data Team at <a href="https://caa.com">CAA</a>. I am only in my first week and everyone has been super helpful and so nice! I am looking forward to designing a research study and diving right in with the support of such an awesome team! I&rsquo;m bummed that moving to LA for the summer didn&rsquo;t work out as I had hoped but I am grateful they were able to accommodate me being a remote employee!</p>
<p>On the personal front, nothing new ha. I guess no news is good news, right? Farzad and I are still living in the house on Taylor St. We do our thing and every once in a while catch some events around this awesome city. We are enjoying our life here with our two kitties, Stevie &amp; Selena (I will never stop posting photos of them - my entire camera roll)</p>
